<p>Data identifying landscape areas (shown as polygons) attributed with geological names. The scale of the data is 1:625 000 providing a simplified interpretation of the geology and may be used as a guide at a regional or national level, but should not be relied on for local geology. Onshore coverage is provided for all of England, Wales, Scotland, the Isle of Man and Northern Ireland. Data are supplied as four themes: bedrock, superficial deposits, dykes and linear features (faults). Bedrock geology describes the main mass of solid rocks forming the earth's crust. Bedrock is present everywhere, whether exposed at surface in outcrops or concealed beneath superficial deposits or water bodies. Geological names are based on the lithostratigraphic or lithodemic hierarchy of the rocks. The lithostratigraphic scheme arranges rock bodies into units based on rock-type and geological time of formation. Where rock-types do not fit into the lithostratigraphic scheme, for example intrusive, deformed rocks subjected to heat and pressure resulting in new or changed rock types; then their classification is based on their rock-type or lithological composition. This assesses visible features such as texture, structure, mineralogy. Superficial deposits are younger geological deposits formed during the most recent geological time; the Quaternary. These deposits rest on older rocks or deposits referred to as bedrock. The superficial deposits theme defines landscape areas (shown as polygons) attributed with a geological name and their deposit-type or lithological composition. The dykes theme defines small, narrow areas (shown as polygons) of a specific type of bedrock geology; that is igneous rocks which have been intruded into the landscape at a later date than the surrounding bedrock. They are presented as an optional, separate theme in order to provide additional clarity of the bedrock theme. The bedrock and dykes themes are designed to be used together. Linear features data (shown as polylines) represents geological faults at the ground or bedrock surface (beneath superficial deposits). Geological faults occur where a body of bedrock has been fractured and displaced by large scale processes affecting the earth's crust (tectonic forces). The faults theme defines geological faults (shown as polylines) at the ground or bedrock surface (beneath superficial deposits). All four data themes are available in vector format (containing the geometry of each feature linked to a database record describing their attributes) as ESRI shapefiles and are delivered free of charge under the terms of the Open Government Licence.</p>

The 1:625 000 Bedrock data were created from two main sources. The geology for England &amp; Wales, Scotland and the Isle of Man is generalised directly from the 1:50 000 scale DiGMapGB-50 V3 data released in 2006 with ongoing revisions through to 2007 incorporating selective interpretations from new 50k maps, anticipating their release as V5 tiles in 2008. The data for Northern Ireland were derived by minor simplification from the 1:250 000 scale geological map of Northern Ireland, published in 2007. Holes in the 50k data were filled using information from other sources. The version 5 data of the 1: 625 000 dykes data was created primarily from the 1:50 000 scale Digital Geological Map of Great Britain (DiGMapGB-50) version 3 dataset (released in 2006) by generalisation involving cartographic selection, modification, simplification or exaggeration and matches that shown on the BGS poster maps of the UK (North and South) published in 2008.

The attributes and nomenclature used follow those on the printed maps. The linear features were fitted to a relevant topographic base at the time of production. The 1:625 000 Superficial data were compiled from two main sources: the latest available 1:50 000 data (together with other information used to fill in the ‘holes’) and the 1:250 000 published Quaternary map of Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>The simplified texture classifications are derived from measured soil textures (%clay, %silt and %sand) taken from archive GBASE and geotechnical samples held by BGS. The samples are compared with a simplified soil-texture triangle used for mySOIL and are grouped by their underlying soil-parent material type to show a map of distribution of the classes; expert judgment has been used to estimate a texture class where sample data is not available). Note that the map uses terms that refer to: Sandy soils, Silty soils, Clayey soils and Loamy soils with additional indicators for the presence of Chalk fragments (Chalky) and Peat (Peaty). Most parent materials generate a broad range of soil textures so these terms should be regarded as 'indicative'. Further information is available from the mySOIL resource page. The GBASE laser granulometry dataset (used in this map later) is also available in the UKSO map viewer.</p>

<p>Water Framework Directive (WFD) Groundwaterbodies Cycle 2 (2014-2019) is a spatial (polygon) dataset which has been created for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). Article 2, clause 2 of the WFD defines them as '…all water which is below the surface of the ground in the saturation zone and in direct contact with the ground or subsoil'. For the purposes of reporting under the WFD a groundwater body represent a distinct body of groundwater flow with a coherent flow unit including recharge and discharge areas with little flow across the boundaries. These reflect hydrogeological characteristics containing information on flow and stage properties, recharge and vulnerability to pollution.

Coastal waters were defined by territorial waters 1 nautical mile from the Mean High Water coastline taken directly from OS 1:50K MeridianTM 2. The delineation between coastal and estuarine waters was delineated by the Environment Agency defined transitional waterbodies. Waterbodies are also split and assigned to River Basin Districts.

<p>This spatial dataset contains the digital boundaries of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) in Wales. SSSIs cover a wide range of habitats from small fens, bogs and riverside meadows to sand-dunes, woodlands and vast tracts of uplands. Most are in private ownership, although some are owned and managed by local wildlife trusts, or other voluntary conservation bodies. Notification of an SSSI under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 has since been amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2001, which brought about numerous changes in the way SSSI are notified managed and protected. In order to ensure consistent, favourable long-term management of these sites, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) with landowners have prepared management plans for all SSSI in Wales. Local planning authorities are required to consult NRW before allowing any development to proceed that may affect an SSSI. Water, gas and electricity companies must also do the same. SSSIs have been designated, from 1949 to the present day, and are on-going. The data has been held digitally since the mid-1990s. This data has been checked by relevant NRW staff. Please refer to the designation map as the legal definitive boundary.

<p>This spatial dataset contains the digital boundaries of all Spatial Protection Areas (SPAs) in Wales. The EC Birds Directive of 1979 requires member states to establish SPAs to conserve the habitats of two categories of birds:<br />
i) Species which are rare or vulnerable, of which there are forty-eight in the UK.<br />
ii) Some migratory species which visit our shores regularly.<br />
SPAs in Wales are identified by NRW, in conjunction with the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee, and designated by the First Minister for the Welsh Assembly Government. These sites are also protected through being Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). The 1994 Conservation Regulations also provide a means of protecting such areas at sea. SPAs together with SACs will contribute to a European Union network of protected sites to be known as 'Natura 2000' (N2K sites).

<p>This spatial dataset contains digital boundaries of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) in Wales. The EC Habitats and Species Directive came into effect in 1992 with the aim of maintaining a rich variety of wildlife by protecting vulnerable habitats, and the plants and animals they support. The Habitat Directive together with the 1979 Birds Directive will lead to the establishment of a series of sites throughout Europe that will be known as 'Natura 2000'. This represents the cream of European sites and will ensure their survival for future generations. SACs have been designated over a number of years, from 1993 to the present day, and are on-going. These sites have been mapped on paper since the mid 1990s and then there was a major review from 2000 with the 'SAC Moderation Project' when the data was captured digitally for the first time.</p>

<p>The Convention on Wetlands, called the Ramsar Convention, is an intergovernmental treaty that provides the framework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources. This spatial dataset contains the digital boundaries of Ramsar sites in Wales. In ratifying the Convention in 1976, the UK government accepted a commitment to promote the conservation of internationally important wetland sites within its territories. Wetlands are vital for many types of birds particularly waterfowl and Wales have some prime sites that are essential to the survival of many wetland plants and animals. Wetland sites can be areas of marsh, fen, peatland or open water; natural or artificial; permanent or temporary; with water that is fresh, brackish or salty. They can also include shallow areas of sea. All Ramsar sites are also Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Wetlands of International Importance are identified by Natural Resources Wales (NRW), in collaboration with the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), and designated by the First Minister for the National Assembly for Wales. The Ramsars have been designated over a number of years, from 1976 to the present day, and are on-going. The data has been held digitally since mid1990s. The boundaries have been checked by NRW staff. Due to scale enlargement and different editions of map a certain degree of interpretation was required.</p>

<p>These are prime wildlife conservation areas in the country, considered to be important on a European as well as Irish level. Most Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) are in the countryside, although a few sites reach into town or city landscapes, such as Dublin Bay and Cork Harbour. Detailed conservation objectives are available for some SACs and as additional ones are approved they will be posted on the NPWS website (www.npws.ie). The legal basis on which SACs are selected and designated is the EU Habitats Directive, transposed into Irish law in the as amended in 1998 and 2005. The Directive lists certain habitats and species that must be protected within SACs This is a national dataset and is split into two separate file download: SACs within the bounds of the ITM coordinate reference system and off-shore SACs which are provided in WGS 84.</p>

",,1,2,,,,97,,,22,86,,,,50,,46,82,,"<p>Soil maps are out of practical necessity based on surveyors predicting what soils occur on those parts of the landscape that they cannot visit. Key soil forming factors such as vegetation (landcover), topography and geology (parent material) were mapped and a set of rules were applied to these datasets to predict the soils that may occur at any given location in the landscape. These maps were then combined to create a predicted model of soil occurrence. Combination of these inputs provided for a modelled output of predicted soils, with this model output termed Level 1. The model was then extended to a Level 2 predictive model which incorporated topographical variables, previously mapped soil data and other geologically based variables such as subsoil permeability, which increased map accuracy. Predictions are based on expert judgement in combination with pre-existing, mapped data (National Soil Survey (NSS) 1959-1980's at 1:126720; General Soil Map of Ireland, 1969 and 1980 at 1:575,000, Peatland map 1978). Both GIS and remote sensing technologies were used in the process. The OSI 20m DTM was used as part of the topographic analysis.<br />

This layer contains an integrated flow network that includes known flow connections through rivers, lakes and groundwater aquifers. In places where the network is depicted flowing through lakes or through underground channels, the flow channels are schematic only, and do not represent the precise location of these flow channels. The appropriate Geological Survey Ireland data sets should be consulted where underground flows or connections are known or suspected.</p>

<p>'Water Framework Directive (WFD) Transitional Waterbodies' is a polygon Shapefile dataset containing attributes that have been collated as defined for the implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). Article 2, clause 6 of the WFD defines them as '...bodies of surface water in the vicinity of river mouths which are partly saline in character as a result of their proximity to coastal waters but are substantially influenced by freshwater flows'. Transitional waterbodies were defined from Mean High Water boundaries, taken directly from OS 1:50K MeridianTM 2, and NRW estuarine boundaries defined for the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (UWWTD). Since waterbodies are attributed with a unique identifier 'EA_WB_ID' this dataset can be linked directly to other WFD data sources such as physical characteristics, risk, classification and proposed objectives. These data apply to Cycle 2 of the Water Framework Directive.</p>

Other input datasets and extensive local Natural Resources Wales staff knowledge has been used to augment the core geometry to incorporate critical spatial detail and attribution, such as flow direction and path, not available from the OS mapping and to verify the accuracy of the centreline itself. Sections of DRN belonging to a particular waterbody have been merged together so that a defined waterbody is a single record within the dataset (rather than being made up of hundreds of records within the DRN). DRN attributes become obsolete at this point and waterbody specific attribution has been added. Therefore the geometry for the resulting waterbodies is taken from the DRN, but the attribution and number of records is very different. Not all sections of the DRN belong to defined waterbodies and the final WFD river waterbody dataset represents &lt;20% of the online DRN.<br />

Article 2, clause 5 of the WFD defines them as '...a body of standing inland surface water'. There is data on the physical characteristics, risk, classification and proposed objectives that can be linked to waterbodies by their unique identifiers. Artificial and modified lake waterbodies are included within this dataset, however, generally only lakes above &gt; 50 hectares were assessed under the WFD except for lakes in protected areas, where a minimum of 5.0 ha was used. Lakes below this threshold are not included within this dataset unless allocated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Each waterbody has been assigned 'EA_WB_ID', which is a unique identifier that enables a link to WFD attributes. These data apply to Cycle 2 of the Water Framework Directive.
